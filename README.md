# Orbit Calculator

### Intro
Web application that uses a [solar system REST API](https://api.le-systeme-solaire.net)
to get the radii and mass of most bodies in our solar-system in order to calculate
the orbital velocity at a specified height above the surface of each body.
If you are interested, you can read more about [orbital velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_speed).
<bold>Note that this API doesn't always give correct information!</bold>
